Euphoria One also known as [Ben Rhine](benrhine.com) is a Denver based trance dj. Originally from Ohio, Ben moved to the mile high city in search of a fresh start and new horizons. While he has been listening to trance music for 20+ years in 2017 he decided he wanted to do more than just be a passive part of the scene but to help keep trance music alive and started teaching himself how to dj. He performed his first livestream in early 2019 and started hosting his weekly(ish) stream Midweek Madness during the pandemic. Post COVID he started performing live shows and festivals and had a very successful 2022.

Ben has had a passion for electronic music since he went to his first club in 2003. In particular he has a passion for the classics and the harder side of trance leaning all the way into happy hardcore and some hardstyle.

In his regular day to day Ben is a Java/Grails developer with a specialty in leading high performance development teams.
